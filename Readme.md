# Python, API and JSON Challenge

What is the weather like as we approach the equator?

Now, we know what you may be thinking: “That’s obvious. It gets hotter.” But, if pressed for more information, how would you prove that? Here we will be answering this question with data analysis.

## Showcase the Relationship between Weather Variables and Latitude

Using OpenWeatherMap API data will be retrieved and used to create a series of plots:

- Latitude vs. Temperature
- Latitude vs. Humidity
- Latitude vs. Cloudiness
- Latitude vs. Wind Speed

Compute a Linear Regression for Each relationship

- Northern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Temperature (C) vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed (m/s) vs. Latitude

## Use Weather Data to Plan Future Vacations

Create a map that shows the humidity for various cities.

Find cities with ideal weather conditions:
- A max temperature lower than 28 degrees but higher than 22
- Wind speed less than 4.5 m/s
- Cloudiness and Humidity less than 67%

Create a map with of the above cities and find a hotel within 10,000 m of the coordinates. Display the hotel information.
